To initialize git

$ git init

Check status

$ git status

To add a file that Git is supposed to start tracking:

$ git add mars.tx

To commit the changes

$ git commit -m "Start Commit"

Rinse and repeat commands as you change your repository.

If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,
git add specifies what will go in a snapshot (putting things in the staging area)
, and git commit then actually takes the snapshot, and makes a permanent record
of it (as a commit).

So far, Git is tracking the changes in your locale, not in an outside repo. If you
have created a repo in your locale, then create one in GitHub and then do the following:

$ git remote add origin ssh

If you initialize it with a readme, then you have to pull the changes to the locale:

$ git pull origin master

Then, you can push your locale repo to the outside repo:

$ git push origin master

An alternative, to create in GitHub, clone and then work in your locale:

$ git clone ssh

Will create a local repo on your working dir with the name of the repo. then, you can change directory, and start the process of git add, git commit, and git push.
